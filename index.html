                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am currently working towards completing a Full Stack Web Development certification at Dixie Technical College.
                    I have found a passion in tech and projects aimed at addressing real-world business needs, 
                    I find fulfillment in leveraging my skills to make meaningful contributions.
                    My approach is marked by a commitment to continuous learning and self-improvement, 
                    constantly seeking out opportunities to expand my knowledge and capabilities. 
                    With an inclination for exceeding expectations, I eagerly embrace challenges and push myself to new heights. <br>
                <br>
                    In my spare time I cherish moments spent with my family. I frequently have my nieces and nephews over for movie nights, 
                    we do tie dye projects, and during warmer months, I enjoy trips to the river, reveling in the joys of nature and outdoor activities. 
                    I love to travel when I can. I seize every opportunity to explore new destinations and add enriching experiences to my adventure list.
                    I love to try new things and add more experiences to my bucket list. I love animals and have done rehabilitation for different snakes and lizards I have come across within the pet industry. 
                    I also keep several reptiles, I find solace and purpose in nurturing these unique creatures.
